# Cookieclicker

![](https://image.ibb.co/c136LS/Screenshot_188.png)

Simple cookieclicker game written in javascript.

My priority was to build interactive javascript game without using any frameworks. 
Game core is written in pure ES6, but I've used some depedencies to make my workflow more professional:

 - Mocha and chai to write tests
 - JSdoc to automatically generate documentation 
 - Standard.js to lint my code 
 - Webpack to bundle all files into one
 - Pug and Stylus preprocessors to write HTML and CSS faster

After downloading the source, run:
```node
npm i
npm start
```
The game will be running on http://localhost:8080/
